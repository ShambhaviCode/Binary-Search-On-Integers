🔍 Binary Search in C 

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching an element in a sorted array.
It works using the divide-and-conquer strategy, reducing the search space by half at each step.


📌 How Binary Search Works

1️⃣ Ensure the array is sorted (Binary search only works on sorted arrays).

2️⃣ Find the middle element:
If it's the target value, return its index.

If the target is smaller, search in the left half.

If the target is larger, search in the right half.
3️⃣ Repeat the process until the element is found or the search space becomes empty.


🖥️ Binary Search Code in C


#include <stdio.h>

// Function to perform binary search

int binarySearch(int arr[], int left, int right, int target)
 
{
while (left <= right)

{

int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

// Check if the middle element is the target

if (arr[mid] == target)

return mid;

// If target is smaller, search the left half

if (arr[mid] > target)

right = mid - 1;

// Else, search the right half

else

left = mid + 1;

}

return -1; // Element not found

}

int main() 

{

int arr[] = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91}; // Sorted array

int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Find array size

int target;

// Get input from user

printf("Enter the number to search: ");

scanf("%d", &target);

// Call binary search function

int result = binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, target);

// Print the result

if (result != -1)

printf("Element found at index %d\n", result);

else

printf("Element not found in the array\n");

return 0;

}




📖 Explanation of the Code

🔹 binarySearch function:

✔️ Accepts an array, left & right boundaries, and the target number.
✔️ Finds the middle index.
✔️ Compares the middle element with the target.
✔️ Adjusts the search range accordingly.

🔹 main function:

✔️ Defines a sorted array.
✔️ Takes user input for the target number.
✔️ Calls binarySearch and displays the result.



📝 Example Output

Enter the number to search: 23
Element found at index 5

Enter the number to search: 100
Element not found in the array




⏳ Complexity Analysis

Best Case (O(1)) → If the middle element is the target.
Worst/Average Case (O(log N)) → Since the search space is halved at each step.



🎯 Why Use Binary Search?

✅ Faster than linear search for large datasets.
✅ Efficient for sorted arrays.
✅ Logarithmic time complexity makes it scalable.
